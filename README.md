Basic algorithm: Acceleration of obstacles

	After the player passes each obstacle, points and speed of movement for all obstacles increase. To create a gap 
	
	between the obstacles we use the time interval. When the obstacles start, the gap between them gradually decreases 
	
	(so the speed increases and it is necessary to keep several obstacles on the screen)
